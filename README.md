# Hi there 
### Welcome to my GitHub space! 😄
My name is Jose. I'm a passionate self-learner and nature lover 🌲 📚. I'm an **Environmental Scientist** 🐢🌻 currently studying at [42 Málaga](https://www.42malaga.com/) in order to become a Software Developer.

<br />
My areas of interest include:

* 🎓 Specialization in Port Management.
* 💧 Master's degree in Environmental Hydraulics.
* 🌍Can speak several languages: English (high proficiency), French (conversational) and actually learning German.
